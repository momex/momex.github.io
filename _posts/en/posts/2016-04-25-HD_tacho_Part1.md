While driving a vehicle we all have in mind at least a couple of basic indicators that give us an idea of the speed and the engine RPMs. In trucks or passenger cars it is common to have more information but in a motorcycle, due to the available space, there is a limitation of info. We can find some models that have 2 gauges with the speedo and a tachometer and other models with one gauge and a LCD to show the speed.<br>
If we look at cheaper bikes or engines that don't rev up too much, everything gets much simpler. The indicators of a Harley Davidson Sportster are very basic, you can find a speedo gauge, some tell tales (fuel, engine check, ...) and a small LCD display to show the odometer, tow partials and the hour.

For a person obsessed with control like me, this ammount of information was obviously not enough, so I decided to start a long term project (almost took me 4 years) in order to design some kind of display to give me some extra information like engine RPMs and gear engaged.<sub>(1)</sub>. <p>

Learning a bit of electronics and develope my own PCB was a pending item in my checklist, so I decided to go for it. As everything I've learned comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank">open source</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software" target="_blank">free software</a> I decided to create this blog in order to return my learnings to the community.<br>

I will divide this project in 13 parts where I will explain the different steps I followed, schematics, designs, code, ...
